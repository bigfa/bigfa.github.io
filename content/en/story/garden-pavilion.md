title: "Garden Pavilion"
description: "Garden Pavilion, formerly known as Rongge, was listed on the Black Pearl list in both 2020 and 2021. Most of the restaurants that have made it to the Black Pearl list on Dianping are highly regarded and unlikely to disappoint. However, Garden Pavilion is no longer featured on the list, which may be attributed to a decline in the quality of their offerings while maintaining the same prices. I no longer recommend it."

Over the weekend, I had a meal at Garden Pavilion, located at the Park Hyatt hotel. Prior to this visit, I was hesitant due to the high average cost per person mentioned on Dianping, ranging from seven to eight hundred yuan. However, since we were staying at the hotel, we decided to give it a try. In all honesty, the overall experience was underwhelming. The atmosphere was pleasant, but the dishes were quite mediocre, and the prices were steep. I would say it was not worth the expense.

In Shenzhen, the Park Hyatt hotel features an impressive atrium with the restaurant Garden Pavilion located on the same floor. It is easily accessible via an elevator that goes directly to the lobby. If you want to go to the guest rooms, you would need to transfer to another elevator. This restaurant has a unique and distinctive ambiance, as it is situated within the building and even features trees growing inside.

I recall that it is usually quite difficult to secure a reservation at this restaurant on weekends. Therefore, I made a reservation in advance for this visit. However, to my surprise, there were not many people when we arrived at our reserved dining time. It appears that the quality of the food has significantly declined, leading to a loss of customers.

As for the ambiance, it was just average. In Shenzhen, you can experience a similar environment at half the price, and the quality of the food is not lacking either. Personally, I do not recommend Garden Pavilion. This was my first time dining at a restaurant in this price range, and I must say that the quality of the dishes was disappointing. Each dish was served with separate chopsticks, and the service was well-maintained, but the overall quality of the food was truly unsatisfactory.

The appetizers were not tasty, and I would say they were not even as good as what you would find at a restaurant that serves complimentary fruit.

The BBQ pork was also mediocre, I think even the black gold BBQ pork from Jingego Restaurant, which costs only a few tens of yuan, is better than this.

Teammate may enjoy it, but personally, I don’t have any particular preference for it.

As a tofu enthusiast, I actually think this dish is decent. However, I have some complaints about the container used. The service is already slow, and when the Mapo Tofu gets cold, it can become a bit fishy. It would be better if they used a stone pot to keep it warm.

The Ice-burned Three-layer Pork is really not up to par. It’s way too greasy.

The Scallion Oil Sesame Crispy Chicken with Stir-fried Conch Slices is claimed to be a soulful dish, but in reality, it’s just average. For me, it’s just at the level of not being unpleasant to eat.

Fried rice enthusiasts find this fried rice to be quite ordinary, nothing special. They add just a few slices of ham and charge over a hundred bucks for it, really speechless about it.

In 2020 and 2021, Rong Ge was once listed on the Dianping Black Pearl, but most restaurants that make it to the list usually maintain a certain level of quality. Now, Rong Ge is no longer on the Black Pearl list, which is reasonable considering their declining food quality while maintaining high prices. I cannot recommend it, especially considering the price of 1150¥ for a meal for two people (excluding drinks).
