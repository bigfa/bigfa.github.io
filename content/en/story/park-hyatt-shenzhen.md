Since successfully completing the Globalist challenge, I have gradually started experiencing Hyatt hotels. In Shenzhen, I only wanted to experience Andaz and Park Hyatt. Last Saturday, I stayed at Park Hyatt Shenzhen. I opted for a cash stay this time, and the price of 2100 RMB on a Saturday was considered reasonable, considering that hotel prices in Shenzhen tend to be higher on weekends.

Park Hyatt Shenzhen is located in the Annex Tower of Ping An Financial Center. In terms of its geographical location, it is considered more of a business-oriented hotel. The Futian district itself is quite established, with many old office buildings in the vicinity. One of the newer buildings is the neighboring Ping An Financial Center, which is also a landmark in Shenzhen. I took a taxi directly to the hotel entrance, and the concierge service was good. Despite the heavy foot traffic, they still managed to handle my luggage and deliver it to my room.

Park Hyatt Shenzhen features an atrium lobby, with the first floor primarily housing the concierge department. To the left is the elevator leading to the lobby, while to the right is a kind of exhibition hall that showcases an intriguing art sculpture.

The lobby has four check-in counters, and when I arrived, there weren’t many people, so there was no need to wait in line. As a Globalist member, I was upgraded to a Sky Deluxe King room, which is a corner room. I didn’t even dare to dream of being upgraded to a Globalist suite, which I had challenged for. Since I had mentioned our anniversary during a pre-arrival phone call and requested some decorations, the room was set up accordingly. Paying in cash definitely has its perks.

The corner room had a good amount of space, and it is the highest room category below the suites.

They provided a welcome fruit platter along with a piece of cake and some luxury chocolates. They also included a personalized welcome card.

The card was even sealed with a wax seal, showing attention to detail.

The room was decorated with a heart-shaped arrangement of rose petals on the bed. I’m not sure what variety of roses they were, but the petals were quite large.

The lighting effect in the evening was stunning.

The view from the guest room was average, compared to Shenzhen Bay, it was quite inferior.

The weather was mediocre, and it was even less transparent when seen through the glass.

The minibar is not complimentary, and surprisingly, even had small bottles of Maotai liquor available.

Many hotels incorporate a lot of mirrors in their design to visually increase the size of the room.

The lighting in the guest room is well done, making it ideal for taking beautiful photographs.

The bathroom is equipped with a bidet, providing all the necessary amenities.

The layout of the corner room is a bit odd, personally I prefer the rooms at Andaz, but the basic rooms at Bo Yue Hotel are a bit more comfortable.

## Pros

For a hotel at this price range, it will have all the necessary amenities, and you’ll often come across some standout features.

1. Prime location, adjacent to Ping An Finance Center, with direct access to Futian Station.
2. The basic room type is spacious and comfortable.
3. The breakfast menu is semi à la carte and the food quality is good.
4. Universal Club offers a complimentary Happy Hour.
5. The swimming and fitness facilities are excellent.
6. The service is great, and the room decoration is well-done.

It is worth mentioning that the hotel’s jacuzzi is excellent. It was my first time using the sauna and it was quite pleasant.

## Cons

While the temperature in Shenzhen is still high in November, the water in the swimming pool was quite cold, and the air conditioning was set to a very chilly temperature, resulting in hardly any people swimming.

1. Globalist generally does not offer suites.
2. The quality of food at Rongge has declined, and the prices are expensive.
3. The room maintenance is average, with signs of aging even though it has only been in operation for a few years.
4. The swimming pool water is too cold.

Regarding the dining experience, the complaints can be found in another article.

## Conclusion

It is unfortunate that I missed the opportunity to experience the lobby bar during this stay. I can only say goodbye until next time. Overall, the Shenzhen Park Hyatt is quite good, it has everything one would expect. It would be difficult to choose between the Park Hyatt and the Andaz.
